.Wav Analyzer!
==============

For reasons, I got extremly curious about wave files, and digital music representation in general. And alhough most know that music is saved in many samples, arranged in a sine wave, and there's plenty of documentation on wave headers, there's not quite a clear place giving byte by byte details of how their encoded. Just what exactly are in these samples?!? Are they a whole wave, or just a tiny portion?

So I'm writting this to get a down-to-ground look at digital sound.
